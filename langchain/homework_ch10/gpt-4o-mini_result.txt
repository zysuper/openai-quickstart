I have obtained the GDP data for the United States from 2000 to 2020. Here are the values:

| Year | GDP in billion current U.S. dollars |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| 2020 | 21,323                              |
| 2019 | 21,521.4                           |
| 2018 | 20,656.5                           |
| 2017 | 19,612.1                           |
| 2016 | 18,804.9                           |
| 2015 | 18,295                              |
| 2014 | 17,608.1                           |
| 2013 | 16,880.7                           |
| 2012 | 16,254                              |
| 2011 | 15,599.7                           |
| 2010 | 15,049                              |
| 2009 | 14,478.1                           |
| 2008 | 14,769.9                           |
| 2007 | 14,474.2                           |
| 2006 | 13,815.6                           |
| 2005 | 13,039.2                           |
| 2004 | 12,217.2                           |
| 2003 | 11,456.5                           |
| 2002 | 10,929.1                           |
| 2001 | 10,581.9                           |
| 2000 | 10,251                              |

Next, I will prepare to plot a line chart using Python with this data.
Now that I have the GDP data for the United States from 2000 to 2020, here‚Äôs how the data can be organized for plotting:

- **X-axis**: Year (from 2000 to 2020)
- **Y-axis**: GDP in billion current U.S. dollars

The following data points will be used:

- 2000: 10,251
- 2001: 10,581.9
- 2002: 10,929.1
- 2003: 11,456.5
- 2004: 12,217.2
- 2005: 13,039.2
- 2006: 13,815.6
- 2007: 14,474.2
- 2008: 14,769.9
- 2009: 14,478.1
- 2010: 15,049
- 2011: 15,599.7
- 2012: 16,254
- 2013: 16,880.7
- 2014: 17,608.1
- 2015: 18,295
- 2016: 18,804.9
- 2017: 19,612.1
- 2018: 20,656.5
- 2019: 21,521.4
- 2020: 21,323

With this data organized, I will now proceed to generate the line chart using Python.
