Here are some key points about U.S. GDP from recent data:

- **2023**: The US GDP was $27,360.94 billion with a per capita income of $81,695 and an annual growth rate of 2.54%.
- **2022**: The US GDP was $25,744.11 billion with a per capita income of $77,247 and an annual growth rate of 1.94%.

These figures are indicative of the U.S. economic performance over recent years:

### Key Insights from Macrotrends
- **GDP Growth**: In 2,857.05 billion in 20,343 per capita with a 1% growth.
- **Inflation Adjusted Growth**:
  - For 2022B (real GDP) with a decline of about 3%.
  - In 2021: $21,428.67 billion, $65,097 per capita, growing by 5.7%.
- **Trends**:
  - Prior to the economic disruption (like pandemic), GDP had been expanding steadily with a growth rate around ~2%-3%.

### Historical Context from The Balance
The historical GDP data shows several peaks and valleys over decades due to various factors including recessions, fiscal policies, monetary policies, and significant events such as the Great Depression of 1,576.04 billion in GDP, and recovery periods.

- **Recessions**: Notably large drops were seen during recessions (like -3% downturns).
- **Economic Recovery**: Post-recession phases saw robust growth rates exceeding ~2%-3% annually.
  
### World Bank Data
The trends from the World Bank data provide a detailed view of GDP per capita since 1960:
- **Long-term Trends** indicate steady rise with notable spikes and troughs correlating economic policies, technology booms/revolutions.

### Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
Latest BEA releases show current real GDP growth rate of ~2.8% for Q3 204.
  
This analysis indicates a consistent yet somewhat volatile pattern in the U.S. economy over recent decades, showing that economic policies and global events significantly impact GDP dynamics.

Here is a chart showing the trends in U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and per capita income from 2019 to 2023:

![US GDP and Per Capita Income Trends](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEU8AAQh2YV8BAABZP//...) 

- **Blue Line (Left Y-Axis)**: Represents the GDP in billion USD.
- **Green Line (Right Y-Axis)**: Indicates per capita income in USD.

From this chart, you can observe how these economic indicators have changed over recent years:
- There's a significant drop in 2020 due to various factors including the global pandemic. 
- A recovery trend is noticeable from 2021 onwards with an increase both in GDP and per capita income.
- The most recent data point shows growth, indicating continued economic improvement after initial disruptions.

This visual representation provides clear insight into the fluctuation of these key economic metrics over time.

For a deeper analysis:
- **GDP Growth Rates**: The approximate annual growth rates were -3.4% in 2020 (due to pandemic effects), recovered with about 5.7% growth rate in 2021, then stabilizing around ~2%-~3% since.
- **Economic Contexts**:
    - Before the economic disruptions: Steady GDP expansion.
    - During the economic disruption: Large contraction.
    - Post-disruption recovery phase: Robust economic growth.

This information underscores the significant impact of global events and domestic policies on U.S. economic performance over recent years.

Based on the data provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and other economic sources, here are some key points regarding U.S. GDP trends:

- In Q3 2024, real gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent.
- Since 2019, there was a significant drop in GDP growth in 2020 due to the pandemic effects; however, robust recovery is seen since then with around ~5% growth in 2021 and stabilizing between ~2%-~3% since.

Additionally, other sources like World Bank data show trends over more years:

- According to [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=US), the US GDP (in current US dollars) has been steadily increasing since 2019 after a notable decline in 2020 due to the pandemic.
  
Further analysis and related trends can be explored using interactive charts from sources such as FRED, which provides detailed data series including estimates for real-time economic indicators like [GDPNow](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=1aEiA).

These resources help in understanding not just the overall trend but also specific quarterly and annual changes in GDP. For a comprehensive view of recent trends, one could refer to USAFacts which provides an analysis of how different economic metrics have performed post-pandemic.

The chart for the U.S. real GDP growth rate, including both annual figures from 2019 to 2023 and the latest quarter estimate for Q3 2024, has been successfully generated. Here's a summary of what you can observe:

- The data shows that in 2019, there was a modest growth of approximately 2.5%.
- In 2020, due to the pandemic impact, there was a significant drop in GDP with a negative growth rate of -3.4%.
- Recovery started strongly in 2021 with an impressive growth rate of 5.7%, followed by more moderate but steady growth rates of 2.3% in 2022 and 2.8% in 2023.
- The latest quarter estimate for Q3 2024 indicates continued stability at around 2.8%.

The line plot visualizes these trends, clearly showing the dip in 2020 and the subsequent recovery and stabilization of GDP growth over recent years.

FINAL ANSWER
The U.S. real GDP growth rate has shown varied trends since 2019:
- In 2019: Growth was at approximately **2.5%**.
- 2020 Pandemic Impact: Significant drop to a negative growth of **-3.4%**.
- Robust Recovery in 2021: A strong rebound with an annual growth rate of **5.7%**.
- Steady Growth Post-Recovery:
    - In 2022, GDP growth stabilized at around **2.3%**.
    - Continued stability seen through 2023 and up to the latest quarter estimate for Q3 2024: approximately **2.8%**.

This summary highlights a pattern of recovery from pandemic impacts followed by stable economic conditions as reflected in the growth rate trends over these periods.
